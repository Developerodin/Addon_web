# Product Import Error Debugging

## What Was Done

I've added comprehensive error logging subscribers to capture **why** your product imports are failing:

### Subscribers Added:
1. **`notification-logger.ts`** - Captures ALL notifications, specifically enhances product import failure logs
2. **`batch-job-failed.ts`** - Catches batch job failures (likely where the actual error is)
3. **`batch-job-processed.ts`** - Tracks successful job completion
4. **`workflow-error-logger.ts`** - Captures workflow step failures
5. **`product-import-error.ts`** - Tracks import batch completion events

## How to See the Error

### Step 1: Restart Your Backend Server
```bash
cd b2b-starter-medusa/backend
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
yarn dev
```

### Step 2: Try Importing Again
After restarting, the enhanced logging will show detailed error information in your console.

### Step 3: Look for Error Messages
When you import, you'll see output like:
```
=========================================
‚ùå BATCH JOB FAILED - THIS IS THE ERROR!
=========================================
Job Type: import-product
Error Message: [THE ACTUAL ERROR HERE]
...
```

## Common Import Errors

Based on Medusa documentation, common causes:

1. **Missing Shipping Profile**
   - Ensure your CSV has a valid shipping profile column
   
2. **Missing Required Fields**
   - Check that all mandatory columns are present
   
3. **Case Sensitivity**
   - Column headers must match exact casing
   
4. **Invalid Data Types**
   - Prices must be valid numbers
   - Dates must be in correct format
   
5. **Foreign Key References**
   - Collection IDs, product types, sales channels must exist
   - Images must be uploaded first

## Next Steps

1. Restart backend
2. Try import again
3. Check console for detailed error logs
4. Fix the specific error shown in logs
